              <p>Long ago, the Pale King ruled over the thriving kingdom of Hallownest, inhabited by intelligent bugs who built 
                a great civilization beneath the surface. But an ancient force known as the Radiance brought forth an infection 
                that consumed the minds of Hallownest's citizens, reducing them to mindless husks driven by orange light.

              <p>
                In desperation, the Pale King attempted to create a perfect vessel, a being without mind, will, or voice, to contain the infection. You play as the Knight, one such vessel, returning to the now ruined kingdom to confront the source of the plague. Piece together the tragic history through environmental storytelling, cryptic dialogue, and hidden lore tablets as you uncover the truth behind Hallownest's fall and your own mysterious origins.
